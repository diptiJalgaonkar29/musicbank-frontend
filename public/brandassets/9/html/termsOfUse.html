    <p className="impr-underline impr-mrgn-top">The Sonic Hub</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Sonic Hub works according to an intelligent search algorithm driven
      by machine learning and music-related parameters and tags. For access to
      the Sonic Hub, amp creates individual User Accounts based on
      information provided by
      <span>BCG</span> and its subsidiaries (first and last name of User,
      E-Mail-Address, name of workplace and country). Upon access to the Music
      Bank, the Users are able to:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Online stream (music can be played in the Sonic Hub);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Track Download (music can be downloaded to an external device): in
          each Music Element page, also called “Music Track Folder”, the User
          may download, when available, the Audio Master (the original
          mastered piece of music) and the Stems (the single instrument tracks
          of a piece).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>
      The Sonic Hub is a web-based application for searching, listening and
      downloading music explicitly developed for
      <span> BCG</span>. Key features of the Sonic Hub include the
      intelligent search algorithm, the browse function, the document section
      and my music. Additionally, in the section my music, each User has the
      possibility to create playlists with favorite tracks and to follow other
      Users’ playlists. This function provides Users fast access to the tracks
      they are currently using i.e. for specific campaigns. It further serves
      as inspiration for all Sonic Hub Users. The search system is based on
      tags describing the emotional attributes of each piece. Each piece can
      have a different number of tags. These tags are carefully assigned to
      each music track by the administrator. The User can search new tracks by
      combining tags.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Users are also able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          select and search for artists, genres, instruments and desired
          tempos, using a search bar or filter function;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          observe the music trends of the moment, based on listening data and
          the number of recorded downloads-observe the most downloaded tracks
          of a selected period;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>observe the most recently uploaded tracks;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          observe suggested tracks, based on the User’s taste (recorded
          streaming and download data);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          filter search results by artist, tags, instruments, genre or tempo.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
